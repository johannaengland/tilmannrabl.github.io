abstract: "Real-time sensor data enables diverse applications such as
smart metering, traffic monitoring, and sport analysis. In
the Internet of Things, billions of sensor nodes stream data
to analysis systems. We thus cannot transfer all available
data with maximal frequencies any more. Therefore, we
need to tailor data streams to the demand of applications.
We contribute a technique that optimizes communication
costs while maintaining the desired accuracy. Our
technique schedules reads across huge amounts of sensors
based on the data-demands of a huge amount of concurrent
queries. We introduce user-defined sampling functions
that facilitate various adaptive sampling techniques,
which decrease the amount of transferred data. Moreover,
we share sensor reads and data transfers among queries.
Our experiments with real-world data show that ondemand
data streaming saves up to 57% in data transmissions
compared to periodic sampling."

abstract: "The advent of Web 2.0 companies, such as Facebook,
Google, and Amazon with their insatiable appetite for vast
amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured
data, triggered the development of Hadoop and related
tools, e.g.,YARN, MapReduce, and Pig, as well as NoSQL
databases. These tools form an open source software stack
to support the processing of large and diverse data sets
on clustered systems to perform decision support tasks.
Recently, SQL is resurrecting in many of these solutions,
e.g., Hive, Stinger, Impala, Shark, and Presto. At the same
time, RDBMS vendors are adding Hadoop support into
their SQL engines, e.g., IBM’s Big SQL, Actian’s Vortex,
Oracle’s Big Data SQL, and SAP’s HANA. Because there
was no industry standard benchmark that could measure
the performance of SQL-based big data solutions, marketing
claims were mostly based on “cherry picked” subsets
of the TPC-DS benchmark to suit individual companies
strengths, while blending out their weaknesses. In this
paper, we present and analyze our work on modifying
TPC-DS to fill the void for an industry standard benchmark
that is able to measure the performance of SQL-based big
data solutions. The new benchmark was ratified by the
TPC in early 2016. To show the significance of the new
benchmark, we analyze performance data obtained on four
different systems running big data, traditional RDBMS,
and columnar in-memory architectures."

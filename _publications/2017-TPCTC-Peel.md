abstract: "During the last decade, a multitude of novel systems for scalable
and distributed data processing has been proposed in both academia
and industry. While there are published results of experimental evaluations
for nearly all systems, it remains a challenge to objectively compare
different systemâ€™s performance. It is thus imperative to enable and establish
benchmarks for these systems. However, even if workloads and data
sets or data generators are fixed, orchestrating and executing benchmarks
can be a major obstacle. Worse, many systems come with hardwaredependent
parameters that have to be tuned and spawn a diverse set of
configuration files. This impedes portability and reproducibility of benchmarks.
To address these problems and to foster reproducible and portable
experiments and benchmarks of distributed data processing systems, we
present PEEL, a framework to define, execute, analyze, and share experiments.
PEEL enables the transparent specification of benchmarking
workloads and system configuration parameters. It orchestrates the systems
involved and automatically runs and collects all associated logs of
experiments. PEEL currently supports Apache HDFS, Hadoop, Flink,
and Spark and can easily be extended to include further systems."
